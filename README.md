# Background-Remover
Automatic remove photo background using the machine learning method.

Background Remover is a Python program that uses machine learning methods to automatically remove the background from photos. The program employs the DBSCAN algorithm to identify the background color and remove the pixels associated with this color, leaving only the foreground subject. With this program, removing backgrounds from images becomes quick and easy for anyone, regardless of their technical proficiency. The project is open-source and provides comprehensive documentation and instructions for using the program.
